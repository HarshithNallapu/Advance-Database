## ER Diagrams
Each selected problem includes:
- A **Chen notation ER diagram** created using **Graphviz**.
- A **Crow’s Foot notation ER diagram** created using **Mermaid.js**.
- A **relational schema** outlining entity attributes and relationships.
- **Design choices and justifications** explaining modeling decisions.

## How to View the Report
